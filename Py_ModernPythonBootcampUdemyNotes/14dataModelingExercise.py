# Modeling a playlist of songs with titles, artists (sometimes multiple), and an order
# For order, use a list; each item in the list should be a dictionary, with the artist key
# associated with a list; the whole playlist-list could be nested in a dictionary with the playlist 
# title and author, etc.
